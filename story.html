<p>Our journey began back in the 1980's, when the founder and owner had an inspirational moment when admiring the beauty and strength of real wood. While attending high school, he decided to create some amazing solid wood furniture pieces for his parents.</p>
<p>Decades have passed and these same furniture pieces still stand today as they did when they were created back then. Styles have changed over the years, but the legacy and longevity of these beautiful pieces carries on.</p>
<p>After successfully managing several furniture retail operations, Homestead Furniture Inc. was founded in 2003.</p>
<p>We are dedicated to offering a wide variety of products manufactured with high quality control standards and joinery, while providing excellent customer service with very affordable pricing.</p>
